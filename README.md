# PyGaSe
**Py**thon**Ga**me**Se**rver

A Python package that contains a versatile lightweight UDP-based client-server API and network protocol for 
real-time online games.

---
***BREAKING CHANGE**: Version 0.2.0 is basically a new API and updating from 0.1.9 or lower will break you code.*
*It is also much more stable, flexible and powerful, so make sure to use 0.2.0 or higher.*

---

### Installation
```
pip install pygase
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

*Under construction*

### Example

[This example game](https://github.com/sbischoff-ai/pygase/tree/master/chase) implements an online game of chase,
in which players can move around, while one of them is the chaser who has to catch another player.
A player who has been catched becomes the next chaser and can catch other players after a 5s protection countdown.

Run `server.py` first, then run `client.py` in additional terminal sessions to add players.
Only use the same player name once.
